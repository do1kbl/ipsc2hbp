# IPSC 2 HBP

Connecting IPSC to HomeBrew Repeater Protocol with DMRlink and HBlink

THIS PROGRAM IS NOW STALE...

It got about 3/4 of the way done and N4IRS and N4IRR did a great job of beating me to it. Please see IPSC_bridge, HB_bridge and Analog_bridge for connecting HBlink and DMRlink together. They will use a standarized way of providing interconnecitons that will also inlcude analog interconnectivity and other digital protocols
